  In this project I created a game which can be played using commands in terminal.
The game is a classic mmorpg where you can chose a hero (warrior/mage/rogue) with different
abilities and skills , buy items from shop , move on a map and have battles with monsters 
(where you can select how to attack him, with speels or not, speels that have a probability to
succes, etc ) . The map is generated random and you can move North/South/
East/Vest and discover shops and enemies. For reading the usernames and passwords of
accounts I used JSON and Design Patterns for other features.
